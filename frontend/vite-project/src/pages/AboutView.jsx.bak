      <p className="about-text">
        HomeCare Pro is your dedicated home cleaning partner for busy families
        and professionals in Coimbatore. We connect you with trusted, verified
        cleaners who treat your space with the same care they would their own.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        Unlike generic marketplaces, we focus only on home and office cleaning.
        That means every part of our experiencefrom booking and pricing to
        feedbackis designed around hygiene, reliability, and safety. All
        cleaners are identity-verified, trained on our cleaning checklist, and
        reviewed after every job.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        You simply choose the service type, preferred time slot, and any
        add-ons. We match you with a nearby cleaner, share transparent pricing
        upfront, and keep you updated over SMS or WhatsApp. Our goal is to make
        booking a trusted cleaner as easy as ordering food online.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        We are starting with Coimbatore and will gradually expand to more
        neighbourhoods and cities. Our mission is simple: hotel-grade
        cleanliness, made accessible and hassle-free for every home.
